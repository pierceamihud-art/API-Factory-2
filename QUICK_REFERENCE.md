# API-Factory Quick Reference Card

> **One-page summary for stakeholders, investors, and new contributors**

---

## 🎯 What Is API-Factory?

A **solo-developer-friendly framework** for building production-ready APIs with:
- 🔑 Built-in API key management & rate limiting
- 💳 Stripe billing integration (auto-provision/revoke keys)
- 📊 Usage tracking & metrics dashboard
- 📑 Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation
- 🧩 Template-based API generation (describe service → get API)

**Target User:** Solo devs & small teams who want to monetize APIs **without reinventing auth, billing, and admin consoles**.

## 📈 Project Status (as of Oct 27, 2025)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Planning** | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive docs, architecture, roadmap |
| **Codebase** | 🔴 Not Started | Zero lines of production code |
| **CI/CD** | 🔴 Not Started | No GitHub Actions workflows |
| **Deployment** | 🔴 Not Started | No hosting/infrastructure |
| **Overall** | 🟡 **Planning Phase** | **0% implementation complete** |

**Reality Check:** Documentation describes completed features that don't exist yet.

## 🚀 Next Milestones

### Milestone 1: Foundation (Week 1) – CRITICAL PATH
**Goal:** Get `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` working  
**Deliverables:**
- Monorepo structure (apps/, packages/)
- Minimal Fastify server with `/healthz` endpoint
- Minimal React admin web
- CI pipeline (lint + test)

### Milestone 2: First Service (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Ship 3 working API endpoints (ping, echo, healthz)  
**Deliverables:**
- All endpoints match OPENAPI.yaml spec
- Integration tests passing
- Admin web can call APIs
- Documentation accurate

### Milestone 3: Monetization (Week 4-5)
**Goal:** Stripe integration + API key enforcement  
**Deliverables:**
- API keys stored in database
- Quota & rate-limiting working
- Stripe webhooks handling subscriptions
- Admin console for key management

### Milestone 4: Launch (Week 6-7)
**Goal:** Production-ready deployment  
**Deliverables:**
- Security audit passed
- Monitoring & alerting live
- Documentation complete
- First paying customer onboarded

## 💰 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (Gate C) | Target (Launch) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Time to First API Call** | N/A | < 5 min | < 3 min |
| **API Endpoints Live** | 0 | 3 | 10+ |
| **Test Coverage** | 0% | 80% | 85% |
| **Documentation Accuracy** | ~30% | 95% | 98% |
| **Paying Customers** | 0 | 0 | 5+ |

## ⚠️ Top Risks

1. **Foundation Debt** (🔴 Active)  
   → Docs describe non-existent code  
   → **Mitigation:** Update README, add PROGRESS_AUDIT.md ✅

2. **CI/CD Gap** (🔴 Active)  
   → No automated testing or deployment  
   → **Mitigation:** Add guardrails.yml workflow (Week 1)

3. **Monetization Slip** (🔴 Active)  
   → Stripe integration not started  
   → **Mitigation:** Prioritize Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)

4. **Scope Creep** (🟡 Potential)  
   → Risk of adding features before MVP complete  
   → **Mitigation:** Ruthless prioritization (Gate C before Gate F)

## 🎯 Definition of Done (Gate C)

A contributor should be able to:
1. ✅ Clone the repo
2. ✅ Run `pnpm install` (no errors)
3. ✅ Run `pnpm dev` (API + Web start)
4. ✅ Visit `http://localhost:8787/_api/healthz` → 200 OK
5. ✅ Visit `http://localhost:5173` → Admin web loads
6. ✅ Run `pnpm test` → All tests pass
7. ✅ Push PR → CI passes

**Current Achievement:** 0/7 ❌  
**Target Date:** End of Week 2

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Phase 0 takes > 3 days** → Planning issues, need to simplify scope
2. **Test coverage drops < 70%** → Code quality degrading
3. **CI stays red > 24 hours** → Process breakdown
4. **Documentation drift > 20%** → Team confusion, wasted effort
5. **No demo-able progress after 2 weeks** → Execution risk

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed (Next 7 Days)

- [ ] **Database Choice:** PostgreSQL vs. SQLite vs. Supabase?
- [ ] **Deployment Target:** Fly.io vs. Railway vs. Cloudflare Workers?
- [ ] **Logging Provider:** Winston vs. Pino vs. Bunyan?
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Sentry vs. LogRocket vs. Self-hosted?
- [ ] **Rate Limiting:** In-memory vs. Redis vs. Upstash?

**Decision Owner:** Project maintainers  
**Deadline:** Before starting Phase 2 (Monetization)
