# API-Factory — U.S. Law & Policy Compliance Framework

Tagline: API-Factory — America’s Secure, Compliant API Marketplace

Purpose
--------
This document summarizes the U.S.-focused legal and policy requirements that are baked into the API-Factory Premium catalog. It maps high-level laws and policies to platform and API-level requirements and provides a checklist for product, engineering, and legal teams.

1. Core Platform Compliance
- FTC Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 41–58): Avoid unfair or deceptive acts. Ensure accurate disclosures and refrain from deceptive practices.
- State Data Breach Notification Laws: Implement incident detection and notification workflows; expose breach-notify webhooks and runbooks.
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Implement baseline controls for identify, protect, detect, respond, recover.
- Privacy Protections: Adopt consent-first architecture (explicit opt-in for data collection and sharing), data minimization, and retention policies.

2. Identity & Access Management
- REAL ID Act: For ID verification products, account for REAL ID considerations and lawful uses.
- NIST SP 800-63: Follow identity assurance, multi-factor authentication, and biometric guidance.
- COPPA: Age-gate services; obtain parental consent and restrict collection for under-13 users.

3. Financial APIs
- SEC & CFTC: Ensure trading APIs are registered if required; maintain records and disclosures for advisory/trading activities.
- Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) & FinCEN AML Rules: KYC/AML for payment / escrow flows.
- CFPB Regulation E: Electronic funds transfer disclosures and error resolution requirements.

4. Healthcare APIs
- HIPAA (45 CFR Part 164): Secure PHI in transit and at rest; implement access logging and minimum necessary disclosures.
- HITECH Act: Breach notification and enforcement rules apply to business associates.
- FDA Device & App Regulations: For integrations that qualify as medical devices, track regulatory status and labeling.

5. Education APIs
- FERPA: Protect student education records; implement access controls, logging, and approval workflows.
- ADA Accessibility Standards: Ensure outputs and UIs are accessible and provide reasonable accommodations.
- COPPA: Protect children under 13 in education services.

6. Consumer & IoT APIs
- FTC IoT Device Security Guidance: Secure-by-default settings, unique credentials, and update/patch support.
- State privacy & biometric laws (CA, NY, IL, etc.): Capture explicit consent for biometric processing and disclosure.

7. Enterprise & Government APIs
- FAA Part 107: Drone mission planning & geofence enforcement for MissionAPI.
- EPA Emissions Standards: Data and reporting requirements for TransitFlow and ClimateProof.
- USDA & FDA FSMA: Traceability and reporting requirements for AgriChain.
- FOIA & Whistleblower Protections: CivicWatch must preserve evidence, logging, and redaction capabilities.

Compliance checklist matrix (see companion CSV)
------------------------------------------------
The companion CSV (`compliance/checklist_matrix.csv`) contains a row-per-control checklist that maps laws to required controls and the APIs that typically need them.

How to use this framework
-------------------------
- Product: Review the catalog entries and attach the relevant law tags to requirements and PRs.
- Engineering: Use `x-compliance` vendor extensions in OpenAPI specs (see `openapi/premium-apis.yaml`) to attach law and control metadata to endpoints.
- Legal/Privacy: Use the CSV to generate risk reports and track mitigation status.

Next steps and integrations
---------------------------
- Add owner, priority, and remediation columns to the CSV.
- Generate per-law views (HIPAA-only, SEC-only) for compliance reports.
- Integrate the checklist into PR templates to require a compliance review for relevant APIs.

If you'd like, I can now:
- add owner and status columns to the checklist CSV,
- generate HIPAA-only and SEC-only filtered CSV exports, or
- add a small script to merge `x-compliance` entries into your live OpenAPI files.
