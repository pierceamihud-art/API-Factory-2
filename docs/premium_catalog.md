For further automation (CSV, OpenAPI vendor extensions), see the companion files:

- `compliance/premium_matrix.csv` — machine-friendly matrix of APIs -> compliance.
- `openapi/premium-apis.yaml` — vendor-extensions mapping each API to legal alignment (x-compliance entries).
- `docs/premium_readme.md` — brief usage notes and validation guidance.

If you'd like a narrower view (e.g., only finance or only health), I can produce filtered versions or add owner and implementation effort columns.
